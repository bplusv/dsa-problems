The square root problem is solved in O(log(n)) time using a binary search algorithm. One possible approach to 
solve the problem is with a divide and conquer style recursive solution, but it could take extra log(n) stack space.
The proposed solution uses a loop and indexes to perform the binary search with constant O(1) space instead.

Time complexity: O(log(n))
Space complexity: O(1)
