Task0: O(1)
    - accesss the texts list by index O(1)
    - print statement O(1)
    - access the calls list by index O(1)
    - print statement O(1)
    The worst case run time is constant.

Task1: O(n)
    - iterate texts in a loop O(t)
        - read calling_number by list index O(1)
        - read answering_number by list index O(1)
        - add calling number to set O(1)
        - add aswering number to set O(1)
    - iterate calls in a loop O(c)
        - read calling_number by list index O(1)
        - read answering_number by list index O(1)
        - add calling number to set O(1)
        - add answering number to set O(1)
    - print statement O(1)
    The worst case run time is linear O(n), proportional to input size of both csv files.
    The set add operation is O(1) on average when implemented by a hash table.
    [O(t) * (4 * O(1))] + [O(c) * (4 * O(1))] + O(1)
    O(t)*4 + O(c)*4 + 1
    O(t) + O(c)
    O(t + c)
    if n = total input size of both csv files: O(n) = O(t + c)
