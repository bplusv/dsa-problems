We can solve this problem in linear time. By using 2 variables we can keep track of the overall minimum and maximum numbers on the array. Since the array is unsorted, we need to check all the items to know the overall min and max values, therefore, we can't do better than linear time. No extras space is needed.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
