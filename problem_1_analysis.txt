Problem_1: O(n)
    - iterate texts in a loop O(t)
        - read calling_number by list index O(1)
        - read answering_number by list index O(1)
        - add calling number to set O(1)
        - add aswering number to set O(1)
    - iterate calls in a loop O(c)
        - read calling_number by list index O(1)
        - read answering_number by list index O(1)
        - add calling number to set O(1)
        - add answering number to set O(1)
    - count assignment and len operations O(1)
    - print statement O(1)
    The worst case run time is linear O(n), proportional to input size of both csv files.
    n = total input size of both csv files: O(n) = O(t + c)
    The set.add() operation is O(1) on average when implemented by a hash table.
    len() operation on list is O(1)
